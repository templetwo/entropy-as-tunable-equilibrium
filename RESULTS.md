# RESULTS — Entropy as Engine

> *Historical document, preserved as pre-registered under the project's original name and question ("entropy-as-engine"). The repo was renamed to entropy-as-tunable-equilibrium after the v3 finding answered the question — see [README](README.md) for the outcome.*

Executor: Claude Code (Opus 4.8, "ultra"), **MacBook Pro seat** (the SPEC targeted the
Studio; this run is the MacBook — see Environment). Verified-before-declared throughout.

## Environment
- hardware: Apple Silicon MacBook Pro (`Darwin 25.5.0`, arm64), 18 GB unified memory, 12 cores
- python: 3.10.12 (pyenv); numpy 2.2.6, scipy 1.15.3, matplotlib 3.10.5
- jax backend / device: **JAX not installed on this seat** → ran the NumPy-fallback path.
  The SPEC's "JAX vmap/jit/scan" 2D pipeline is replaced by an equivalent **vectorized
  NumPy engine** (`src/sc2d_fast.py`: all grid points' walker ensembles evolved as one
  `(G, n_paths, 2)` float32 array) plus **multiprocessing** fan-out over the (geometry, τ)
  grid (`src/run_fast.py`). Oracle-validated against the reference triple-loop
  (`run._sc_field_2d`): field correlation **0.993**, relative-L2 **0.005**.
- seeds: fixed and logged. Phase 0 seeds `s*131+j`; Arm A seed 0 (+7 for the driven run);
  Arms B/C seed 0 with `seeds=3` averaged per S_c field.
- sampling (Arms B/C): grid 44×28, `n_paths=700`, `seeds=3`, endpoint-entropy `bins=28`,
  contrast `βT_c = 3/(S_c.max−S_c.min)` (matches the reference normalization).
- wall-clock: Phase 0 7.6 s; Arm A 6.4 s; Arm B 176 s (16 τ × 10 procs); Arm C ~14 min
  (5 L_ch × 16 τ); D-scan diagnostic ~13 min (5 D × 14 τ). All on CPU.

## Phase 0 reproduction  (`python -m src.phase0_validated_1d`)
- argmax migration:           **−3.66 → ~0** (monotone)   — expect −3.7 → ~0  ✓
- mass-in-B (option-rich):    **0.483 → 0.668** (monotone) — expect 0.48 → ~0.67  ✓
- KL(engine‖eq) range:        **0.79 – 1.14** (never ~0)   — expect ~0.75 – 1.16  ✓
- control: fixed, argmax −2.4 in deep well A, mass 0.527 (τ-invariant)  ✓
- **reproduces Phase 0?  [x] yes**  — figure `figures/phase0_tau_overlay_3d.png`

## Arm A — conservativeness  (`python -m src.run --arm A`)
- KL(driven‖analytic): **0.0002**
- overlap:             **0.993**
- **verdict:  [x] PASS (analytic shortcut OK for Arms B/C)**  — figure `figures/armA_conservativeness.png`
- Tighter than the web-seat preliminary (0.012). The overdamped causal entropic force is
  conservative, so `p_engine ∝ exp(βT_c S_c)` is used in B/C (no driven trajectories).

## Arm B — 2D crossover  (`python -m src.run_fast --arm B`)
- chamber tuning: prior SPEC defaults put thermal mass in the LARGE chamber
  (`P_L_control ≈ 0.67`, backwards). Retuned `ChamberChannel2D` defaults to
  `d_S=5.5, r_S=0.6, d_L=2.0, r_L=1.8` → **`P_L_control = 0.371`** (thermal favors SMALL),
  large chamber still 9× the area (option-rich). τ* is NOT tuned — Arm C's scaling is the claim.
- P_L control (fixed): **0.371**
- P_L(τ): **0.511 → 0.910**, strictly monotone non-decreasing (16-pt log τ grid 0.2→18;
  min step +0.006). Engine sits near 0.51 at τ→0 (≈ uniform S_c, half the domain is x>0 —
  options not yet differentiated) and migrates to 0.91 as the horizon reveals the
  option-rich chamber. The thermal control (0.371) never moves.
- τ*: **1.33** (first half-rise crossing of thresh 0.640) / **2.44** (logistic midpoint).
  L_ch²/D = 1.5²/1 = 2.25 — the logistic midpoint brackets it almost exactly.
- **engine ≠ control?  [x] yes** — decisively (Δ = 0.539 at long τ). Figure
  `figures/armB_crossover.png`.

## Arm C — discriminator  (MAKE-OR-BREAK)  (`python -m src.run_fast --arm C`)

| L_ch | L²/D | τ\* (first-cross) | τ\* (logistic) | P_L_control | P_L_max |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0 | 1.00 | 1.57 | 2.85 | 0.382 | 0.917 |
| 1.5 | 2.25 | 1.33 | 2.44 | 0.371 | 0.910 |
| 2.0 | 4.00 | 1.15 | 2.27 | 0.355 | 0.902 |
| 2.5 | 6.25 | 1.09 | 2.32 | 0.336 | 0.897 |
| 3.0 | 9.00 | 1.07 | 2.54 | 0.318 | 0.892 |

- fit τ* = slope·L_ch²/D (through origin): slope **0.180**, **R²(origin) = −17.7** (worse than a constant).
- affine fit: τ* = **−0.057·(L²/D) + 1.50** — slope ≈ 0; τ* is flat-to-slightly-**decreasing** over a 9× sweep in L²/D.
- linear through origin?  **[ ] no**
- **VERDICT:  [x] the SPEC's prediction τ\* ∝ L_ch²/D FAILS — reported honestly (not tuned away).**

**Why it fails (diagnosed, self-consistent).** Under the analytic steady-state shortcut
`p_engine ∝ exp(βT_c S_c)`, mass is placed wherever S_c is high *with no transit time* —
there is no "particle migrating through the channel over τ." S_c inside the large chamber
is high as soon as that chamber *self-explores* (τ ≳ r_L²/D ≈ 3.2), **independent of the
channel**. So the P_L crossover is gated by **large-chamber exploration, not channel
traversal** — which is L_ch-independent. The mild *decrease* is mechanism, not noise: as
L_ch grows the wall (thickness ~L_ch in x) widens and eats into the large chamber, so
P_L_control and P_L_max both fall monotonically (0.382→0.318, 0.917→0.892) — the effective
chamber shrinks → faster self-exploration → smaller τ*. The steady-state P_L metric simply
cannot see the channel-traversal time.

### Diagnostic — is τ\* a genuine diffusive geometric timescale?  (`python -m src.diagnostics --scan D`)
Vary the diffusion constant D (via friction γ at fixed kT=1, so p_eq ∝ exp(−U) and the
control are D-invariant — a confound-free knob). If τ* is a diffusive time r_eff²/D it must
scale as **1/D**.

| D | τ\* (first-cross) | τ\* (logistic) | τ\*·D | P_L_control |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.5 | 2.32 | 5.80 | 1.16 | 0.371 |
| 0.7 | 1.83 | 3.67 | 1.28 | 0.371 |
| 1.0 | 1.33 | 2.43 | 1.33 | 0.371 |
| 1.4 | 0.95 | 1.69 | 1.33 | 0.371 |
| 2.0 | 0.69 | 1.25 | 1.38 | 0.371 |

- fit: τ* = **1.23/D, R²(through-origin in 1/D) = 0.973** (logistic: 2.71/D, R² = 0.975).
- τ*·D constant: mean 1.30, std 0.08 (first-cross) — i.e. **τ\* ∝ 1/D**. P_L_control is
  identical (0.371) at every D → the equilibrium is untouched, the knob is purely kinetic.
- **Conclusion:** τ* is a genuine *diffusive geometric* timescale (∝1/D, R²≈0.97) that is
  *independent of the channel length* (Arm C). It tracks the **chamber-exploration** time
  (~r_L²/D in magnitude), not the **channel-traversal** time (L_ch²/D) the SPEC predicted.
  Figure `figures/diag_Dscan.png`.

### What survives, what doesn't (honest summary)
- **SURVIVES:** entropy-as-engine generates real, horizon-dependent organization. The knob
  is genuine (Arm B: monotone P_L(τ), engine≠control by Δ≈0.54), the steady state is the
  conservative analytic one (Arm A), and τ* is a true *diffusive geometric* time (∝1/D).
- **DOES NOT SURVIVE:** the specific **channel-length fingerprint** τ* ∝ L_ch²/D that the
  SPEC designed to rule out "the entropic force is just a disguised reward." With the
  steady-state P_L observable it is not realized — τ* tracks r_L²/D instead. The
  disguised-reward objection is therefore **not** closed by this experiment as built.
- **RECOMMENDED v2 (to actually test the channel fingerprint):** a *dynamical* observable
  that must physically cross the channel — e.g. mean first-passage time of F_ce-driven
  particles from the small chamber to the large one vs L_ch — which is channel-traversal
  gated and would scale as L_ch²/D if the engine claim holds. Steady-state P_L cannot probe
  it; this is a metric limitation, not (yet) a refutation of the engine.

## Prior art & how to read this result  (see `docs/PRIOR_ART_AND_NOVELTY.md`)
The Arm C negative is **not a surprising bug — it is a rediscovery of a foundational result**,
and that framing is the honest one:
- **Why Arm C *had* to fail with a steady-state metric.** Under detailed balance the stationary
  occupancy is ∝ exp(−βU_eff) with `U_eff = −T_c S_c`; it depends only on per-site free energies
  and is **provably blind** to barriers and inter-site path lengths. Channel-traversal time
  `L_ch²/D` is a *kinetic* quantity that lives only in dynamical observables (rates, MFPT). This
  is the thermodynamics–kinetics separation: Hänggi–Talkner–Borkovec, *Rev. Mod. Phys.* 62 (1990);
  Gardiner; van Kampen. The `L²/D` scaling is canonical diffusive first-passage and *will* show up
  in the MFPT — just not in occupancy.
- **The deepest tension (states it plainly).** Arm A found the position-only overdamped causal
  force is **conservative** → its steady state is an equilibrium-like Boltzmann form with **zero
  probability current and zero entropy production**. So in this regime "engine entropy" is
  **thermodynamically indistinguishable** from a readout relaxation to `U_eff`; the τ-dependence of
  `U_eff` is the *only* thing separating them. That is exactly why the **τ knob** (not a
  current/entropy-production measure) is the distinguishing probe here, and why the discriminator
  must be **kinetic**.
- **The "disguised reward" objection is the consensus view, not a flaw to hide.** Causal-entropic
  forcing is mathematically an entropy-of-futures intrinsic reward (Shah 2014; Ramírez-Ruiz et al.,
  *Nat. Commun.* 2024, Maximum Occupancy Principle); S_c is a Maximum-Caliber path entropy (Pressé
  et al. 2013). The contribution is the *experimental epistemology*: the τ probe, the engine-vs-readout
  framing, and a pre-registered prediction that failed for a principled, diagnosed reason.
- **Sharpest honest thesis for v2:** engine and readout entropy can be *thermodynamically
  indistinguishable* (identical occupancy, zero current) yet *kinetically distinguishable* (different
  first-passage signatures under the τ-knob). v2 = MFPT **and its fluctuations** (TUR: Gingrich–Horowitz
  2017) between chambers vs `L_ch`, plus a direct broken-detailed-balance / probability-current test
  (Battle–Broedersz, *Science* 2016) — predicted null here, which would itself be a clean result.

## v2 — First-passage discriminator (the kinetic test)
v1 showed the engine's *steady-state* occupancy is blind to channel length (Arm C). v2 tests
the complementary **kinetic** observable. Critically, v1's 2D "wall + channel" has a
barrier-free shortcut along y=0 (the wall term vanishes at y=0), so the crossing is gated by
the well-depth ridge, not the channel length — which is *why* occupancy (and a naive MFPT)
can't see L_ch there. v2 uses a clean **1D corridor** (two asymmetric wells — option-poor
narrow + option-rich wide — separated by a flat plateau of length `sep`, the genuine diffusive
bottleneck). Code: `src/landscape_v2.py`, `src/v2_firstpassage.py`, `src/v2_current.py`.

**Part A — kinetics sees the corridor.** Mean first-passage time L→mid under natural dynamics:

| sep | sep²/D | MFPT | CV |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | 16 | 22.7 | 0.99 |
| 5 | 25 | 47.3 | 0.98 |
| 6 | 36 | 79.8 | 1.00 |
| 7 | 49 | 109.5 | 0.95 |
| 8 | 64 | 138.1 | 0.99 |

Fit **MFPT = 2.42·(sep²/D) − 12.5, R² = 0.992** — first-passage cleanly carries the corridor
signature, the exact `L²/D` scaling v1's occupancy could not. (CV ≈ 1 → near-exponential FPT,
i.e. escape-dominated with a diffusive corridor term.) Figure `figures/v2_firstpassage.png`.

**Part B — occupancy carries no corridor-time signature.** Thermal P_R (option-rich basin) is
**flat** in sep (0.46→0.52, spread 0.05) — detailed balance: occupancy is a functional of free
energies only. The *engine* occupancy is **not** flat (0.78→0.60): its effective potential
`U_eff = −T_c S_c` is geometry-coupled (the growing open plateau is option-rich, so it pulls
future-seeking mass toward center). But this is a *steady-state S_c effect, not the kinetic
`sep²/D` signature* — the corridor *time* lives only in Part A.

**Part C — the thermodynamic null (with a positive control).** Probability-current /
broken-detailed-balance test (`mean angular current ⟨L_z⟩`) on a 2D rotor `F_rot = ω(−y,x)`:

| ω | ⟨L_z⟩ |
|---|---|
| 0.0 | **+0.0009** (conservative — engine's regime) |
| 0.5 | +0.98 |
| 1.0 | +1.97 |
| 2.0 | +3.99 |

The detector works (⟨L_z⟩ ≈ ω·⟨r²⟩, clear current for ω>0) and reads **zero at ω=0**. By Arm A
the causal entropic force is conservative → it *is* the ω=0 case → **zero steady-state current,
zero entropy production**. Under every standard NESS detector it registers as equilibrium.
Figure `figures/v2_current.png`.

**v2 verdict.** The sharp thesis is **demonstrated**: in this regime, engine and readout entropy
are **thermodynamically indistinguishable** (identical occupancy structure, zero current — Parts
B, C) yet **kinetically distinguishable** (first-passage carries the `sep²/D` corridor signature —
Part A). The engine-vs-readout distinction is real but lives in *dynamics*, not in occupancy or
in any current/entropy-production measure. This both **resolves v1** (the L-signature occupancy
discarded is recovered kinetically) and **confirms the prior-art diagnosis** (the thermodynamics–
kinetics separation; `docs/PRIOR_ART_AND_NOVELTY.md`). Honest caveat: this establishes that the
*landscape's* corridor time is kinetic-only; a stronger v3 claim — that the **τ-knob** leaves a
first-passage fingerprint no static U(x) can mimic — needs engine-*driven* first-passage under
`U_eff(τ)` across τ, which is the natural next step.

## Honest caveats
- Ran on the MacBook (NumPy fallback), not the Studio (JAX). The 2D engine is
  oracle-validated against the reference (corr 0.993, relL2 0.005), but the absolute S_c
  values are MC estimates (endpoint-histogram entropy, finite n_paths/bins); what carries
  the claims is the *structure* (τ-monotonicity, crossover location, L_ch/D scaling), not
  absolute entropies.
- `βT_c` is renormalized per τ to a fixed contrast of 3 (reference convention); P_L
  migration is driven by *where* S_c peaks, which is contrast-invariant.
- **The "r_L" attribution is inferred, not directly measured.** What is *measured*: τ* is
  channel-length-independent (Arm C) and scales as 1/D (D-scan) → a diffusive geometric
  time. That it is specifically the *large-chamber* exploration length (r_L) follows from
  (i) the magnitude match (τ*~2.4 vs r_L²/D=3.2) and (ii) the wall-shrinkage mechanism
  (P_L_control & P_L_max fall as L_ch widens the wall into the chamber). A direct r_L sweep
  would confirm it; it has a thermal confound (P_L_control rises with r_L) and was left as
  a follow-up.
- τ* estimators: first-crossing of the half-rise threshold (sensitive to P_L_max noise)
  and a logistic-midpoint fit (more stable). Both agree on the Arm C verdict (no L_ch
  scaling) and the D-scan trend.
- This is a *negative* result for the SPEC's specific discriminator, reported per the SPEC's
  own falsifier clause ("a negative result here is a real, publishable outcome — do not tune
  it away"). The chamber tuning that flipped thermal to favor the small well is legitimate
  setup (it changes the *control*, not τ*); τ* itself was never tuned.

## v3 — Production confirmation (honest negative in conservative 1D)

Re-ran against real `src/landscape_v2.py:Corridor1D` + `causal_entropy` (committed generator `src/v3_produce.py`, no sandbox reconstruction).

- Production manifest: `results/v3_manifest.json` (8000 traj/cell main, 8000 for scaling; 9 log τ × 9 sep; seed 42; wall ~minutes on M3 Pro after increases for better-conditioned α fit).
- MFPT(τ) is a monotone kinetic dial: distributions slide left and sharpen as horizon grows (real measurement).
- Reducibility to static U_eff(τ) = −βT_c S_c(τ) is a *definitional* consequence of Arm A (F_ce is conservative). In 1D every force is curl-free; running the identical SDE twice and KS-testing is circular and was removed. No such p-values are presented as findings.
- Scaling: measured α(τ) ≈ 0.7–1.1 (drift/ballistic under the driven force). This is *not* thermal diffusive sep²/D (α=2 from v2). α≈1 is generic for drift; it does not by itself separate the entropic engine from a disguised reward. Fig 4 and docs corrected.
- Current (the real empirical anchor): engine ⟨L_z⟩ ≈ 0 (CI crosses zero); Rotor2D ω=0.5 control shows nonzero current + directional FPT asymmetry (p ≈ 2.5e-5).
- Seven publication figures by pure loader `src/v3_figures.py` (no random, no literals). Generator committed.
- Honest outcome: in this conservative 1D regime the engine is thermodynamically indistinguishable from equilibrium relaxation in a τ-tunable U_eff(τ). The τ-knob produces a visible dial in kinetics, but that dial is equilibrium dynamics in the effective potential. The negative ("no fingerprint that no static potential can mimic") is the result. It correctly names the frontier as v4 (non-conservative force, 2D+, curl ≠ 0, where a non-circular test becomes possible).

v3 re-confirms the core thermodynamic finding of v2 rather than advancing past it. All artifacts on `v3-confirmation`; human reviews and pushes.
